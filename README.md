# simply-artnet
A basic experimental ArtNet DMX data receiver written in Python. Currently supports only the `OpDMX` directive for 1 universe and 510 channels. Requires the full DMX data to be sent every time.

**NOTE**: This project has **not been tested** and will only work if you're lucky. It seems to be compatible with [MA Lighting dot2 onPC](https://www.ma-dot2.com/en/software-download/).
